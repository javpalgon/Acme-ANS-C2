This project named Acme AirNav Solutions is a project made by 5 students (C1.013) from  
the University of Seville, using Acme Framework to provide a robust and efficient information  
system for airport logistics and operations management. Our focus is on streamlining resources  
and optimizing charter flight logistics. Our system will cover key functionalities such as flight  
scheduling, booking management, crew coordination, incident reporting, and aircraft maintenance.


It is intended to be a core learning asset for the students  
who have enrolled the Design and Testing subject of the Software Engineering curriculum of the  
University of Seville. This project helps them start working on their new information system  
projects.
